Agentic samples with Semantic Kernel

## Project Overview

This project, semantic-kernel-agents, is a collection of agentic samples built using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework. The repository demonstrates how to create, configure, and run AI-powered agents leveraging Semantic Kernel's orchestration capabilities. The samples are written in C# and serve as practical examples for integrating large language models (LLMs) and plugins to automate decision-making, planning, and tool usage in real-world scenarios. This project is designed for developers interested in building intelligent agents that can interact with various services and APIs using Semantic Kernel.
